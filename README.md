# Distributed Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition Under Communication Constraints :robot:

This package contains the code to execute the decomposition of a set of tasks assigned to a Multi-Agent system such that each agent only has tasks with its neighbours over the communication graph without requiring distributed state estimation to satisfy the STL tasks.


## Installation
The package was tested with `python3.11`. The package `polytope` has shown to have problems of compatibility with numpy in other python versions.

```
pip install -e .
```
It is recommended to create a separate virtual environment on your computer to download the packages. Either with [Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)  ot via [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
